## ‚ùå Bad Examples

```bash
# Too vague

# Wrong type

# Missing scope
feat: add validation

# Wrong mood
feat: added email validation

# Too long description
feat(auth): add email validation for registration process to prevent users from using temporary email addresses

# No type
add email validation

# Wrong format
FEAT: Add email validation
```

## üîÑ Pull Request Title Format

Pull Request titles should follow the same convention as commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

### Examples

- `feat(auth): add email validation for registration`
- `fix(upload): resolve PDF thumbnail generation issue`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
- `chore(deps): update axios to latest version`

## üö´ What Not to Do

1. **Don't use generic types**:
   - ‚ùå `update: fix stuff`
   - ‚úÖ `fix(upload): resolve file upload issue`

2. **Don't be vague**:
   - ‚ùå `fix: bug`
   - ‚úÖ `fix(auth): resolve login validation error`

3. **Don't use past tense**:
   - ‚ùå `feat: added new feature`
   - ‚úÖ `feat: add new feature`

4. **Don't make it too long**:
   - ‚ùå `feat(auth): add email validation for registration process to prevent users from using temporary email addresses`
   - ‚úÖ `feat(auth): add email validation for registration`

5. **Don't forget the scope**:
   - ‚ùå `feat: add validation`
   - ‚úÖ `feat(auth): add email validation`

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Automation

### Pre-commit Hooks
